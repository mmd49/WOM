            <p>The concept of data privacy covers the collection, use, and secure storage of personal information (PI), in general.  Internet privacy is covered under the data privacy umbrella and is mainly related to how PI is exposed over the internet, via tracking, data collection, data sharing, and cybersecurity threats.  As cyber attacks become increasingly advanced, more controls and internal protections are needed in response.  The chance for personal data to be compromised online has grown significantly over the years.  Unfortunately, instead of one universal law regulating online privacy, there are a group of federal and state laws that apply. </p> 
<p>Personal information for employees, partners, and customers can all be at risk if there is a data breach at a company.  There are several ways that users within an organization can mitigate the chance of personal information being compromised.  For example, improve web browsing habits by using the most secure browser and activating the pop-up blocker, keeping anti-virus software updated, and using distinct passwords for each website login.  Cookies are files placed on the local device by the browser which allow the web server to uniquely identify the user.  They can also be used to track your online behavior and this behavioral data can than be sold to third parties.  To avoid this situation, delete cookies after every session or configure the browser to not allow cookies at all, if possible.  A user’s IP address is what uniquely identifies the local device and is considered to be personal information.  The best way to protect the IP address is to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) tool which encrypts the IP address and hides the user’s location and transmitted data.  Connecting to a web site using the standard HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) allows for hackers to intercept the data transmissions.  Using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) ensures the data is encrypted and protected from any undesirable entities.  Cloud computing allows for a remote user to take advantage of the extensive storage and computing power available in the cloud data center.  The downside is that all technical management and administrative autonomy is passed to the cloud data center, an outside party.  It is possible that the cloud provider has inadequate processes and procedures for data backup and security and it is the responsibility of both the provider and the user to ensure proper security measures are in place.  </p>
<p>Even when combining the pertinent government directives with the best practices for users, cyber attacks are only mitigated, not eliminated.  An additional measure can be taken by a company’s compliance and legal department to employ thorough threat analysis and response measures to protect the firm’s personal information. </p>
