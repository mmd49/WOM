            <p>Edward Snowden was a member of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) with access to top-secret information from the National Security Agency (NSA).  He provided copies of documents detailing multiple worldwide surveillance programs involving the NSA, European governments, and telecommunication firms.  When the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, occurred, the NSA was embarrassed that they did not detect this plot ahead of time.  There was a growing demand within the U.S. government to stop the next attack before it happened.  The result was developing a mass surveillance program by the NSA to determine who was a threat without the need for warrants.  The program monitored the phone calls, text messages, and internet traffic of hundreds of millions of U.S. citizens and attempted to find suspicious activity.
                </p>
            <p>efore September 11, 2001, the NSA had already developed a surveillance program called Thin Thread which was capable of spying on everyone in the world with built-in protections to hide U.S. citizens' information.  However, those in the top-level positions of the NSA chose to deploy the program with the safeguards for U.S. citizens removed.  Only a small handful of NSA employees were aware of the program’s capabilities and sworn to secrecy.  Several of those employees took exception to the program's legality and resigned in protest after their concerns were quashed.  One of those who left, William Binney, raised a concern with Diane Roark, a member of Congress’s House Intelligence Committee.  Diane Roark agreed that the program was illegal and unconstitutional because the government removed the controls and protections for U.S. citizens and was met with the NSA, General Michael Hayden, to discuss her concerns.  Hayden advised that the program was lawful because they had the commander-in-chief's blessing and his wartime powers provided the necessary authorization.  Subsequently, Roark and Binney both filed a complaint to the Department of Defense. The results of the investigation were classified and hidden from the public, and eventually, both whistleblowers were raided by the FBI in response.  Thomas Tamm was an attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) responsible for preparing FISA warrants for the court, which allowed eavesdropping on U.S. citizens.  When he discovered that the program was circumventing the FISA warrants, he raised his concerns with his superiors but to no avail.  He eventually went to meet with a congressional staffer who also stonewalled him.  He eventually leaked the information to the New York Times, resulting in the USDOJ bringing ethics charges against him.  Although the multiple whistleblowers involved were discredited and censored, and in Snowden’s case branded as a dissident and traitor, finally, on September 2, 2020, a U.S. federal court ruled that the mass surveillance program was illegal and possibly unconstitutional.
