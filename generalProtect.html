            <p>Unfortunately, when it comes to online communications, security and convenience are inversely positioned.  This risk means that as transmissions become more secure, they also become more challenging to use and manage.  User privacy is compromised by Internet Service Providers, search engines, retail websites, social media platforms, and the government.  Personal data is being sold to 3rd party marketers while credit reporting agencies are being hacked, and consumer and corporate information are stolen.  It is strongly recommended that a password manager application is utilized to store all passwords for all applications that are in use.  Of course, a super-strong password must be set up to safeguard access to the password manager.  Password strength can be validated on the howsecureismypassword.net website.  The answers to security questions for your passwords should also be stored in the password manager.  This password manager allows arbitrary solutions that cannot be discovered by researching the user's relevant information.  Only use traditional passwords because biometric data is not secure and only use a customized password on your internet router (preferably managed using a password manager). </p> 
<p>SMS two-factor authentication uses a code sent to your cell phone as the second part of the login validation, but it is a security risk.  Google Authenticator is a better alternative but has not been widely adopted, so using SMS authentication is better than nothing.  For your computer, a program like CCleaner can be used to permanently delete sensitive files so they cannot be recovered and an application like BitLocker can provide drive encryption to protect your data from unauthorized access.  Choose Mozilla Firefox over Google Chrome for web browsing to ensure a more private transfer of data.  Firefox offers extensions that include an ad-blocker and a tracker-blocker.  It is also vital that Flash and JavaScript are disabled within the web browser. </p> 
<p>When browsing the web, only use trusted add-ons, extensions and frequently clear any cache, cookies, and browsing history.  A personal VPN will hide your identity on the sites you visit, and it will encrypt your data so nobody can see it.  These people include your ISP, the government, and even hackers.  When using social media, try to hide real information (including your phone number), limit your interaction with family and close friends, and disable unnecessary permissions used by the applications.  Whenever possible, disable location and Bluetooth services, activate VPN, and remove any unused apps from your phone as well as your computer.  Standard texting, SMS messaging, and Facebook Messenger are insecure.  Better alternatives include iMessage (proprietary to iPhone) and Signal, which offer universal compatibility and even encrypts phone calls.  Standard email providers offer no security whereas ProtonMail provides end-to-end encryption, but unfortunately, this will require you to change your email address.  Comparing the iPhone with Android from a security standpoint, the iPhone is much more secure out of the box.  These facts cover just the necessary steps needed to secure your data and communications. </p>
