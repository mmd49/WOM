            <p>A single website or application could contain dozens of trackers building a detailed profile based on a user’s online surfing habits.  This is a seamless process that occurs without the user being aware.  The largest tech companies such as Google, Facebook, and Apple have pledged to put policies in place to protect user data but there is significant doubt that this will happen quickly, if at all.  One of the main streams of revenue for these giant firms is the selling of user data to to third party companies.  The makers of the search engine DuckDuckGo have pushed for making the “do not track” mode the standard configuration for the industry.  Unfortunately, this idea is a decade old and many firms and websites have yet to conform and become compatible with this type of standard.  </p>
<p>User data is collected using cookies which are small files placed on your local machine by your browser when you visit certain websites.  The two types of cookies are session cookies and persistent cookies.  Session cookies allow a user to navigate between different section of a website without having to reauthenticate.  They are only stored as long as your current session and should be removed automatically when the user disconnects from the website.  Persistent cookies are permanently saved to your local machine when you visit certain website frequently.  These are used mostly by marketing firms to track your browsing history which enables them to send you targeted advertising which appears on multiple websites that you visit even if the ad is not relevant to the website.  Depending on the user, this experience could be considered intrusive or welcomed.  </p>  
<p>User data can also be collected by using browser fingerprinting.  When you connect to a website, the web server can instruct your web browser to execute some JavaScript code on your local machine.   The code can be used to capture installed browser extensions, browser types, time zones, screen resolution, installed adblockers, available fonts, local machine hardware specs, and many other characteristics that when combined make up the browser fingerprint.  A VPN (Virtual Private Network) can be used to hide a user’s IP address but the user is still susceptible to being tracked because there are so many other data points that comprise a browser fingerprint. </p> 
<p>The types of user information that is collected is used to make individual profiles for each user that enables firms to develop models that can predict their behavior online and in the real world.  These profiles are very valuable and are sold to third parties including banks, landlords, and insurers that can use them to make decisions on loan approvals, rental approvals, and insurance premiums.  Marketing firms also use these profiles to gear their targeted advertising. </p>
<p>It is not possible for a user to completely avoid being tracked but there are options to reduce the amount of user information that is captured.  Clear the browser history and cookies after each session and use a browser like Mozilla Firefox that offers extensive privacy settings such auto-deletion of cookies after each use and Incognito mode for web surfing.  Regularly monitor the amount of permissions granted to applications because sometimes more access is requested than what is actually needed to perform the expected service.  A positive side-effect of monitoring app access is that apps that are running in the background and consuming resources will be cleared out and the local device will operate more efficiently.  There is no recourse for the legal collection of user data other than opting out of the terms of service and discontinuing the use of the application or website.  The benefits of the service provided must equal or outweigh the negative aspects of user data being tracked and captured. </p>
