            <p>A browser fingerprint is hardware and software information about the device, which is captured by interaction with the web browser of the device.  JavaScript uses this information to create a unique identifier for a user’s computer and browser combination.  JavaScript is a computer language for web programming responsible for the complex interactions that occur on websites such as an image slideshow or animated icons.  To accomplish this interactivity, JavaScript requires access to the host machine's characteristics whether it is a computer or a smartphone.  These characteristics include screen resolution and orientation, browser type and related plugins, operating system type, default language, local time zone, installed applications, etc.  JavaScript can execute a font test which will capture the unique way that the host machine performs text rendering.  WebGL functionality and a canvas test capture how the local device displays graphics and can also be used by JavaScript to obtain additional identifying characteristics.  A single feature is not enough to uniquely identify a computer/browser combination, but the compilation of many traits allows the generation of the unique ID.  The downside of browser fingerprinting is that user privacy is severely impacted.  A user will not remain anonymous even if they are using private browsing mode, which would typically block any tracking of the user’s activity. </p>
<p>There are several options for mitigating the ability of the Internet Service Provider to obtain a browser fingerprint of the host machine, but none of them are foolproof.  One option is to use a particular version of the Mozilla Firefox browser with built-in protection against browser fingerprinting; however, it will not completely stop the unique ID from being created.  Another option is to use the Tor web browser which uses the Tor network to hide your identity but again, it will not completely stop the unique ID from being created.  The most effective way to block the ID from being built is to disable JavaScript in the browser. Unfortunately, most websites employ JavaScript for much of their functionality so turning off JavaScript will make most websites unusable.  Another option is to try not to use a unique browser or unique browser plugins but again, this is not a surefire solution.  There is no quick and complete solution to this user privacy issue.  The long-term solution is to increase public awareness of browser fingerprinting and push for legislation forcing Internet Service Providers to create a  cease and desist from using it in the future. </p>
