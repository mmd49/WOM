            <p>Our personal and private data has been used to develop digital products that are incredibly profitable to marketers and retail companies.  We are unaware of the vast amount of residual data collected and used to generate targeted advertising.  Google tracks our current and past locations, how fast we drive to get there, and where we are planning to travel in the future.  Facebook captures our hobbies, friends, and personal tendencies.  Initially, people consider this waste material, but eventually, organizations realized the value of the data.  Big corporates used some of this data to enhance services but most of it used to develop models of human behavior.  These models allow the firms to predict what a person will do now and in the future.  This data is considered a behavioral surplus because it is more than what is required to improve products and services.  In-person purchasing activity is combined with online activity to build predictive algorithms that give insight into our personality, emotion, sexual orientation, political beliefs, etc. </p> 
<p>Pictures uploaded to social media are used to create algorithms that recognize facial features and predict human behavior.  These predictions are sold to companies that use them to maximize their value.  This facial recognition software is also sold to companies that support the military operations of governments which use it to continually monitor specific populations of people including oppressed religious sects and protesters of authoritarian regimes.  These data collection processes have been designed to operate behind the scenes and keep users ignorant.  Subliminal queues using word manipulation online was proven to be effective in changing real-world behavior.  </p>
<p>Google is the pioneer of surveillance capitalism, and it emulated this logic with a game it designed called Pokemon Go.  This augmented reality game lured users to specific locations based on the rewards and penalties of gameplay.  Then Google sold the predicted footfalls of these potential customers to local businesses in the form of “lure modules.”  The entertainment of the game enables the users to be herded into individual retail locations without them realizing it.  But capturing online activity was not enough.  Google Nest home security cameras have a microphone built-in that captures behavioral data in human conversations, but there is no mention of it in the manual.  When it was discovered and publicized, Google claimed they were not aware of it.  Other Google devices that provide a service while also collecting your data such as thermostats and smoke detectors have privacy contracts that indicate that if you do not agree to have your data collected, the device may stop functioning correctly.  This revelation means the proper operation of the device is contingent upon you having your data captured and sold to third party companies.  These third parties are not required to disclose how they are using your data and Google is not responsible if the data is misused for nefarious purposes.
